NOTES:

Gozintas.calculateTipIndividual only works for page 5b, not for page 5. Page 5 does the calculation in the page, which we might want to refactor

Gozintas.calculateTotal only works for page 5b
	Also might be doing the wrong thing -- returning twice means only the second one is probably correct -- do some error checking on that

Need someway to cull down the for loops in 5

Make sure booleans for billModifier are being set -- page.js line 47+

Handlekeyups doesn't change booleans, so the divs wont show on page 5 for split-by group

Showpage5inputs really only works for page 5b -- kind of a dumb oversight, but make sure to rename this properly or combine with 5 showpage


Aaron questions/conundrums
	Setup and get working on iphone
	.live events cant be put in page.js -- strategy for this?
	Lots of for loops that "seem" neccesary -- strategy for this?
	First page loading -- still an issue
