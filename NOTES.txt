NOTES:

Gozintas.calculateTipIndividual only works for page 5b, not for page 5. Page 5 does the calculation in the page, which we might want to refactor

Gozintas.calculateTotal only works for page 5b
	Also might be doing the wrong thing -- returning twice means only the second one is probably correct -- do some error checking on that

Need someway to cull down the for loops in 5

Make sure booleans for billModifier are being set -- page.js line 47+

Handlekeyups doesn't change booleans, so the divs wont show on page 5 for split-by group
